I'll implement a payment system for User Contracts and Memberships. Let's start by implementing the necessary backend and frontend components.

First, let's look at what we have in the codebase related to memberships and contracts:

Searched for files matching *membership*.js, no matches

Let's check for controllers and services related to memberships and contracts:

I see we need to create controller and routes for the membership system. Let's start by implementing the backend for fetching memberships and creating contracts.

Step 1: Create the Membership Controller
Let's create a controller to handle membership operations:

Membership.Controller.js+62-1
Now let's create a Contract Controller to handle contract operations:

Contract.Controller.js+84-1
Now let's create the routes for both Membership and Contract:

Membership.Routes.js+16-1
I'll continue creating the Contract routes and then implement the frontend components.

Contract.Routes.js+16-1
Now we need to register our new routes in the main application file. Let's check the app.js file to see how routes are currently registered:

Read app.js

I'll now update the app.js file to register our new Membership and Contract routes, and then implement the frontend components.

app.js+4-0
Now let's update the associations to make sure our models are properly linked:

Read associations.js

Now that I've set up the backend routes and controllers, let's update the associations to include our Contract and Membership models:

associations.js+24-0
Now let's implement the frontend components needed for the membership and contract system. I'll create:

A service to interact with our new backend endpoints
Components for displaying memberships and contracts
A new page for users to view and select memberships
Let's start by creating a MembershipService:

MembershipService.js+78-1
Now I'll create the frontend components for the membership system. First, let's create a component to display membership options for users to select from:
